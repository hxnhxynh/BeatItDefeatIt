About the game:
Beat It Defeat It is a rhythm/music game set in the floating city of Arcadia, the music capital of a futuristic world. You play as an up-and-coming DJ who just moved to the city, eager to express their love for music but disillusioned by the corruption. In your quest to master all the genres of music and become Master DJ of Arcadia, you must explore the many music scenes of the city, meet new musicians, and eventually, defeat them in rhythm battles.
To progress through the game and story, you must explore the three different locations in Arcadia (Lizard Lounge, Rattlesnake Shack, and Das Klub) and defeat their respective bosses (Mr. Smooth, Lady Beatrice, and Lautstar-K).
Interacting with the world is very simple. To talk to characters and access another area, press enter. To progress through a conversation with an NPC, press space. To move your character around the map, use the left and right arrow keys.
In these rhythm battles, you are asked to press a sequence of arrow keys in order before pressing the space bar to fire your attack. The timing of the space bar is dependent on the BPM of the song for each battle, which is in increasing difficulty and speed.

How to start:
To start the game, please run main.py.

Bugs:
The last battle engine (at Das Klub) currently does not transition to the ending engine as it should when the song ends, to do so, please press the T key.
Every rhythm battle is able to be skipped using the T key for testing purposes.
